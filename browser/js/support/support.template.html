			In under 4 years, Kinetic has already implemented 5 successful projects and helped over 200 students begin their journeys toward becoming lifelong social innovators. In Fall 2016, we are launching chapters on 10 more college campuses across the U.S. With your help, we will continue to add new campuses to the Kine c Network, expanding the reach and impact of students all around the United States.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the coming years, Kinetic Global will work to develop key issue areas and leverage network learning to maximize our impact. In 2016-2017, each chapter will have teams working on food insecurity, homelessness, and environmental sustainability. By focusing on three key issues, students will be able to leverage the resources of the Kinetic Global Network to have a deeper, more meaningful impact in their communities.
		</p>

		<p>
			Kinetic Global has a lean operating budget for the depth and breadth of our work. We rely on volunteer contributions and small donations from the community at large in order to continue and expand our operations. If you believe in the ability of empowered students to impact real change in your community, please consider supporting the growing Kinetic Global Network.
