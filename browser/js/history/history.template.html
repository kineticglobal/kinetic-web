	<p class='first'>
		Kinetic was founded in the fall of 2013 by a group of first-years from Williams College who sought a more effective way to move from theoretical conversations about social issues to tangible ac on. The original group was called the “Think Tank” and was advertised as an action-oriented group that used a three-phase system of “research, design, and implementation” to create sustainable solutions to pressing issues.

		By the spring of 2014 the organization had teams working to address food insecurity, water use/accessibility, and energy conservation. The first major success occurred with the Food Insecurity team, which was able to design a partnership between Wild Oats Market and the nearby North Adams Food Project. Their implemented system of “suspended groceries” allowed patrons of Wild Oats to purchase food items on behalf of those who could not afford them. These food items were then made available to food-insecure North Adams residents through the Food Project.

		In 2015, the organization officially came to be known as Kinetic, a name which embodied its focus on turning students’ “potential” into “action.” That year, Kinetic systematized its process of social innovation, compiled resources for future teams, and launched a second chapter at Brandeis University.

		In 2016, Kine c members Jessica Bernheim and Bryan Jones were awarded  first prize in the Williams College Business Plan Challenge to scale Kine c beyond its ini al two chapters at Williams and Brandeis. With this funding, the Kinetic Global Network was incorporated in the summer of 2016 and has since grown into a nationwide network of chapters with an expected membership of 10 schools and over 250 active students by the end of 2016.
