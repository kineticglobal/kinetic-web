			Kinetic was founded in the fall of 2013 by a group of freshmen from Williams College who sought a more effective way to empower their peers to move from theoretical conversations about social issues to meaningful action. The original group was called the “Think Tank” and was advertised as an action-oriented group that used a three-phase system of “research, design, and implementation” to create creative, sustainable, and scalable solutions to pressing issues.

			By the spring of 2014 the organization had teams working to address food insecurity, water use/accessibility, and energy conservation. The organization was formally named Kinetic, an allusion to the “kinetic energy” that serves as a counterpoint to “potential energy.” In 2014, Kinetic had its first successful implementation. Kinetic’s food insecurity team designed and implemented the Suspended Groceries initiative. Suspended Groceries creates a partnership between a supermarket and a food pantry and addresses two key issues: the lack of healthy perishable goods available at food pantries and the stigma associated with government programs such as SNAP. Suspended Groceries allows shoppers at a food market to “suspend” – purchase without taking the item home – any of 5 pre-selected items such as a fresh fruit, a fresh vegetable, milk, or eggs. After an item has been suspended, a coupon is created for that specific item and made available for food-insecure community members to use at the same food market. Suspended Groceries is an excellent example of the type of localized, creative, sustainable and scalable initiatives that Kinetic teams design and implement.

			In 2015, Kinetic systematized its process of social innovation, compiled resources for future teams, and launched a second chapter at Brandeis University.

			In 2016, Kinetic members Jessica Bernheim and Bryan Jones were awarded first prize in the Williams College Business Plan Challenge to scale Kinetic nationally. With this funding, the Kinetic Global Network was incorporated as a non-profit in the summer of 2016 and has since grown into a nationwide network of chapters. By the fall of 2016, Kinetic Global will have 10 Kinetic chapters at universities across the country with over 150 active student-members.

			Kinetic teams have already successfully implemented five solutions, and Kinetic teams are currently working on designing and implementing many more.
