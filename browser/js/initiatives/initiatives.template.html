				<h2>Williams College - Suspended Groceries (2014)</h2>
				<p>Williams’ Food Insecurity team identified two problems in their local food system: the first was that low-income individuals had limited access to fresh, healthy food, and the second was that these same individuals also faced a social stigma when using SNAP, or food stamps, in order to pay for groceries. In partnership with a local co-op, Wild Oats, they implemented a program in which shoppers elect to “suspend” - pay for an item without taking it home - any of 6 pre-selected healthy perishable goods, such as a pound of broccoli, a dozen eggs, or a gallon of  milk at checkout. Once shoppers have suspended these items, coupons are created for those same products and then distributed at a local food bank or community supported agency so that the coupon recipients can shop for their suspended items at the participating supermarket or grocery store. The coupons were designed to resemble commonly used coupons to avoid the stigma often associated with SNAP. Since being implemented, Suspended Groceries has spread to several grocery stores across the country in Massachusetts and Arizona.</p>

				<h2>Williams College - Roots Rising (2015)</h2>
				<p>After implementing Suspended Groceries in 2014, Williams’ Food Insecurity team decided to turn their attention to education around sustainable agriculture and food systems. The team partnered with Alchemy Initiative, a non-profit based in the nearby town of Pittsfield, to design a program that would engage young people in their local food system. Roots Rising is a food and agriculture-based youth development program that gives teens work opportunities on farms, in community kitchens, and in local food pantries and provides them with educational workshops on essential life skills. Roots Rising seeks to insert youth directly into their food systems, providing them with work that is meaningful, rewarding, and educational.</p>

				<h2>Williams College - Kinetic in the Courts (2015)</h2>
				<p>Williams College Juvenile Empowerment team set out to create a program that would shift the way at-risk youth are treated in the court system. Through interviews with various officers and judges in the local court system, the Kinetic team decided to design an alternative sentencing program for the local juvenile court in which sentenced youths would be led through a Kinetic-style design thinking exercise to address bullying in their local communities. In the Summer of 2015, two members of the Juvenile Empowerment team and four sentenced youths went through the Kinetic process of research, design, and implementation to create a short video and interactive fiction story that explain the effects of bullying in their community.</p>

				<h2>NYU - The People’s Supermarket Project (2016)</h2>
				<p>While studying at NYU’s London Campus in the Fall of 2016, a Kinetic student team decided to take action to help with the ongoing refugee crisis. Inspired by Suspended Groceries, a previous Kinetic project, the team sought to find a way to seamlessly integrate donation to important causes into everyday life. Working with The People’s Supermarket in London and HelpRefugeesUK, they developed a system where customers would “suspend” - pay for an item without taking it home - tinned goods right at the register, adding nothing to their trip but an extra item on their receipt. These goods were then distributed to various refugee camps, including one that NYU London students volunteered at as part of their study abroad programming. The project has since been integrated into the NYU London curriculum, ensuring sustained participation in managing and allocating donations.</p>

				<h2>USC - Food for Thought (2017)</h2>
				<p>USC’s Food Insecurity team decided to tackle the problem of food waste after learning that about half of the produce grown in the United States ends up being thrown out, even if it is perfectly edible. In their research, they found that education programs have been particularly effective in teaching people how to make the most of food that is visually unappealing, and how to judge exactly when produce is past its prime. With a clear idea of what they wanted to teach, they sought partners in their community that were already doing work to help people make the most of their produce. In collaboration with With Love, an organization dedicated to bringing healthy and affordable food to its neighboring community, and Imperfect Produce, which makes use of produce that would normally be discarded for purely aesthetic reasons, the team designed a series of cooking demonstrations, seminars, and brochures to help teach people how to make the most of their produce. Moving forward, USC’s food insecurity team hopes to carry out these efforts with local schools and on their own campus and foster a new culture of food awareness among Los Angeles’ youth. </p>

				<h2>NYU - Mental Health (2018)</h2>
				<p>Many NYU students have voiced their complaints about the relative ineffectiveness of NYU's current mental health hotline. A considerable amount of students have expressed their desire to casually talk to a peer or coeval rather than someone who is a decade or two older than they are. To address these issues, the NYU’s Mental Health team has put together an online anonymous peer-counseling network for NYU students to use. The Kinetic team has installed a live-chat feature on the website that will allow visitors to chat with any one of their volunteer peer counselors about a range of issues. Visitors can choose to remain anonymous and are not required to identify themselves or others. All peer counselors are required to undergo extensive Title IX, sensitivity, and mental health training, all of which are provided by NYU for free. The website is meant to serve as both an information hub for some of the more prevalent mental health issues in college communities and as a place for students to connect with our peer counselors. <a href='https://kineticmentalhealth.tumblr.com/'>View the NYU Mental Health Website</a></p>
