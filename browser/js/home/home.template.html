					<h1> About Us </h1>
					<p>
						Kinetic was founded with the idea that students want to impact change but did't know
						what to do or how to start. The Kinetic Global Network provides students with
						resources to get started. As members of the Network, students are able to take
						advantage of mentor advice, digital resources, and an easy-to-use methodology. As
						such, student members can spend less time thinking about how to get started and more
						time taking action in their communities!
					</p>
					<p>
						What began as a group of 15 students seeking a more effective way to create change
						has grown into a network of chapters across the US. Ultimtely, Kinetic Global
						envisions a culture of boldly engaged citizens who combine empathy, analysis, and
						action to create innovative solutions to social issues.
					</p>

				<div>
					<h1> Why Kinetic </h1>

			<h1> Sponsored Issues for 2016 </h1>

			<p>
				The power of Kinetic Global Network is in the number of motivated college students
				working on the same issues so that they may serve as resources to learn from each
				other. As such, Kinetic Global has selected three sponsored issues that have shoen a
				great deal of interest among our members.
			</p>

			<p>
				These issues, homlessness, food insecurity, and environmental sustainability are
				pervasive issues meaning that they affect a large number of people in all regions of
				the country. Kinetic Global has compiled databases of mentors and experts on these
				issues that will help facilitate your understanding of the issue during the research
				phase and offer guidance and advice on your team's path towards implementation.
