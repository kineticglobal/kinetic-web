	<h1 class='header'> What is Kinetic Global </h1>
	<p class='tag-line tag-line-what-is'>
		Kinetic Global is a network of student-run social innovation incubators operating on college campuses across the US. Our organization is built and sustained by students with a desire to implement creative non-political solutions to pressing social issues. We provide resources to turn their ideas into realities.
	</p>

	<br>

	<p class='tag-line tag-line-what-is'>
	Our teams use a three phase process of <strong>research</strong>, <strong>design</strong>, and <strong>implementation</strong>.

				Each team begins the Kinetic process with in-depth research to thoroughly understand their issue and to identify gaps or “pain points” where they can design solutions.

		<p class='header-text'>
			Kinetic was founded to help college students move beyond theoretical conversations to meaningful action. Kinetic began at Williams College with 15 college students seeking more effective ways to address social issues. It has expanded into a national network of college students, in which chapters across the US are working to effect positive, tangible change in their communities.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class='header-text'>
			The Kinetic Global Network provides students with the structure and resources to carry out a three-part process of research, design, and implementation. The Network provides access to an advisory network, mentorship, a tested methodology, valuable digital resources and a network of smart and passionate fellow social innovators at universities across the country.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class='header-text'>
			 Ultimately, Kinetic Global envisions a culture of boldly engaged citizens who combine empathy, analysis, and action to create innovative solutions to social issues

	<h2 class="header"> Key Issues </h2>
	<div>
		<p class="text-content">
			The power of the Kinetic Global network lies in the number of motivated college students working on the same issues and learning from each other in the process. For this reason, Kinetic Global has selected three key issues that have interested our members in the past.
		</p>

		<p class="text-content">
			These issues - homelessness, food insecurity, and environmental sustainability - affect a large number of people in all regions of the country. While they are national in scope, they manifest differently in our local communities, providing Kinetic members an important entry point to intervene.
		</p>

		<p class="text-content">
			Kinetic Global has compiled databases of advisors and mentors for each issue. These resources should facilitate teams’ understandings of the issue during the research phase and help provide guidance and advice during the design and implementation phases.
