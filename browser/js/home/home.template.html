			<h2> About Us </h2>
			<p>
				Kinetic was founded with the idea that students want to impact change but did't know
				what to do or how to start. The Kinetic Global Network provides students with
				resources to get started. As members of the Network, students are able to take
				advantage of mentor advice, digital resources, and an easy-to-use methodology. As
				such, student members can spend less time thinking about how to get started and more
				time taking action in their communities!
			</p>
			<p>
				What began as a group of 15 students seeking a more effective way to create change
				has grown into a network of chapters across the US. Ultimately, Kinetic Global
				envisions a culture of boldly engaged citizens who combine empathy, analysis, and
				action to create innovative solutions to social issues.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2> Why Kinetic </h2>

			<p>
				Kinetic serves an integral role in empowering college students to affect change.
				Every day civically minded students are having conversations about problems they
				identify in their communities and world at large.
			</p>

			<p>
				With Kinetic, students turn these meaningful conversations into tangible action.
				Students from different academic backgrounds can get started impacting change with
				Kinetic's step-by-step method, database of mentors and experts, and passionate
				peer groups at universities across the US!

	<h2> Sponsored Issues for 2016 </h2>

	<p>
		The power of Kinetic Global Network is in the number of motivated college students
		working on the same issues so that they may serve as resources to learn from each
		other. As such, Kinetic Global has selected three sponsored issues that have shown a
		great deal of interest among our members.
	</p>

	<p>
		These issues, homelessness, food insecurity, and environmental sustainability are
		pervasive issues meaning that they affect a large number of people in all regions of
		the country. Kinetic Global has compiled databases of mentors and experts on these
		issues that will help facilitate your understanding of the issue during the research
		phase and offer guidance and advice on your team's path towards implementation.
