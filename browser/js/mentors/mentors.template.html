	<p class='text'>
		Kinetic Global Mentors are young professional volunteers who are excited about working with students on their social innovation projects. Mentors offer expertise either in one of Kinetic’s key issue areas or in managing the Kinetic process.

	<p class='text'>
		Often, mentors were once Kinetic team leaders themselves. Whether a student team is looking for advice on different models for food support or on how to manage a team’s transition when a key member is going abroad, mentors are a great resource to reach out to. They’re excited to work with teams and can be contacted below!
