	<h1> History </h1>

	<p>
		Kinetic was founded in the fall of 2013 by a group of first-years from Williams College who sought a more effective way to move from theoretical conversations about social issues to tangible ac on. The original group was called the “Think Tank” and was advertised as an action-oriented group that used a three-phase system of “research, design, and implementation” to create sustainable solutions to pressing issues.
